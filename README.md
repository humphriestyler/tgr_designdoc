Design Document for The Gaming Room's Draw it or Lose it


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

ANSWER: The Gaming Room is a small video game design company that currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems.
The game is a mobile app based loosely on the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn.
Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large
library of stock drawings as clues.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

ANSWER: I personally believe my recommendations were well-thought out based on the company's requirements and requests.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

ANSWER: By knowing the company's requirements and requests, I was able to design the program completely customized for them. It also helps make adjustments or
fixes because the developers know exactly what the client is looking for.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

ANSWER: I would revise my recommendations for security. I'm unsure if my recommendation in the design document was what the company would need
exactly, and therefore may not be the best solution.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

ANSWER: It's important to consider the user's needs for various reasons. ONe of the most important reasons in my opinion is financial. The user is paying
the developer for a service, that being designing a program based off of what they require. Just like a meal at a food service industry where the customer
pays for a meal cooked specifically for them, customers in the technology field pay developers to make a program specifically for them.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

ANSWER: Keeping the customer's requirements and requests in mind, I tried my best to make the recommendations best suited for their intentions on how
the game will be played, all while making sure it ran well and didn't have any major security concerns.
